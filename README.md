variational approach to quantum spin liquid in a Rydberg atom simulator, arXiv:2112.13688
The document named 'basis.jl' calculates the configuration number. 
The 'spin liquid.m' calculates v by minimizing the energy and obtains expectation values for other operators.
The 'experiment.m' gets v by fitting the experiment datas.
