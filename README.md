variational approach to quantum spin liquid in a Rydberg atom simulator, arXiv:2112.13688

The document named 'basis.jl' calculates the configuration number. (C. Li)

The 'spin liquid.nb' calculates v by minimizing the energy and obtains expectation values for other operators. (Y. Cheng)

The 'experiment.nb' gets v by fitting the experiment data. (Y. Cheng)
